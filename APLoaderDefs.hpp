#pragma mark - ResetCallback

    /*!
     \brief Defines a function that performs a user implemented Propeller reset.

     This callback might be useful in situations where user code can use GPIO pins of a board
     such as a Raspberry PI but modifying this code is not an option.

     User code must provide a callback that manually performs the reset. The callback is expected
     to drop the reset line low, hold it low for resetDuration, and then raise the line and return.
     
     The callback is called on the worker thread created for performing the loader action.

     The loader will begin its boot wait immediately after the callback returns (unless the action
     being performed is a reset, in which case it will finish the action).

     Exceptions thrown from this callback are caught and will cause the loader to abort the action.
