         Analysis of the Propeller's booter program determined that 115200 bps is the fastest
         commonly supported baudrate that can be used reliably over the entire RCFAST frequency
         range, given a large allowance for jitter (Â±10%).

         Even though it might work -- or appear to work -- exceeding 115200 bps is unwise because
         the booter program uses a relatively weak error detection mechanism (a one byte checksum
         for a 32 Kbyte image). If faster loading is desired then a bootstrapping loader should

         \brief A constant that helps determine when stage 4 (sending the command and image) ends.

         The a_sendBytes function returns as soon as all of its bytes have been buffered. This may
         be much earlier than the bytes actually being sent over the wire. If we're sending a large
         image and didn't wait after a_sendBytes the checksum status stage would start too early.
         This could result in a significant number of checksum status transmission prompts
         being buffered for transmission before the Propeller has even received the image.

         a_sendBytes returns an estimated drain time based on the assumption that transmission
         begins immediately and continues without interruption. The loader will wait until the drain
         time for sending the command and image -- minus this constant -- before ending this stage.
         This is insurance against the drain time being over-estimated.

         Sending timely status prompts is critical. It will take the Propeller approximately
         50 to 130 ms after receiving the last bit of the image to calculate the checksum. After
         this it will wait about 100 ms for a prompt before aborting the serial loading process

         transmission prompts to the Propeller. The Propeller needs a transmission prompt
         to send the status code after doing the checksum comparison, EEPROM programming, and EEPROM
         verification steps.

         The Propeller must receive a prompt within about 100 ms after being ready to send a status
         code, otherwise it will abort the serial loading process and attempt to boot from EEPROM.
         Therefore this interval must not be too high. Keep in mind there is some overhead and
